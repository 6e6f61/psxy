TODO
====

- I'm not sure if memory is managed in a very ergonomic way right now. `memory.setBios` smells.
- Fix log.zig fn name
- Elaborate on what endianness is in mem.zig load32from
- Document how to buld (there's submodules)
- Remove references to wordsize
- the readme code block is broken?

Very far future
----------------

- Reverse engineered BIOS reimplementation
